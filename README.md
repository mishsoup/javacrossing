Java Crossing is a visualization tool that gives you general inspection of how each function and class contribute to the whole project. This is achieved by running dynamic analysis on your Java code and ouputting the results in an animated graph.


**Steps to use this program:**
1. Move the input Java project into the input folder of the Javacrossing. <br>
   _We used our project 1 Moozeek as the input_ <br>
   Link to Moozeek: https://github.com/mishsoup/moozeek
2. Git clone javacrossing-react into Javacrossing folder <br>
   Link to javacrossing-react: https://github.com/jammyk/javacrossing-react
3. Open terminal and change directory into the javacrossing-react folder and type in “npm install” <br>
   ** or uncomment the line in shell.sh which has “npm install” commented out
4. Cd back into javacrossing folder and type in “chmod +x shell.sh” into terminal
5. Run the command “./shell.sh”
